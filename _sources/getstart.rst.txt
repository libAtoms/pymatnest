Example input files
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

LJ Cluster with the supplied fortran code, using MC
---------------------------------------------------

This input file will start a calculation of 6 Lennard-Jones atoms 
in a cubic cell with volume 648 Angstrom^3, using the potential implemented in the supplied fortran routine,
and using MC trajectory for generating a new sample configuration. As the shape 
and volume of the cell will not be changed, a cluster will be formed by the atoms.
Note that the input parameters given below, such as the number of walkers and length of trajectory, 
are for a short test run. For six atoms this calculation should take only a couple of minutes on one processor, and although
the calculation should end up in the global minimum octahedral cluster structure, 
thermodynamic variables will not be necessarily well converged.

.. literalinclude:: ../example_inputs/inputs.test.cluster.MC.fortran
    :language: python

Periodic LJ with ``LAMMPS``, using MD
--------------------------------------------------------

This input file will start a calculation of 64 Lennard-Jones atoms 
in a cell with variable shape and size at the set pressure value, using the potential implemented in ``LAMMPS``
and using MD trajectory for generating a new sample configuration. 

.. literalinclude:: ../example_inputs/inputs.test.periodic.MD.lammps
    :language: python

Periodic binary LJ with the supplied fortran code or ``LAMMPS``, using MD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This input file will start a calculation of a binary Lennard-Jones system, with 32 A-type atoms and 32 B-type atoms.
Note that in case of multicomponent systems swap moves have to be introduced, when the coordinates of different atomic types are swapped.
The cell is of variable shape and size at the set pressure value.

.. literalinclude:: ../example_inputs/inputs.test.periodic_binary.MD.FORTRAN_LJ
    :language: python

Molecule with ``LAMMPS``, using MD
---------------------------------------------------------------

Start a nested sampling simulation with a polymer in a cell with constant volume and shape. Initially the random placement of atoms has to be turned off, 
and a configuration file has to be read. The initial walk is done with a heuristic choice for E_max.
The ``atom_style full`` used in this example is part of the MOLECULE package, you have to include that when compiling
``LAMMPS``.

.. literalinclude:: ../example_inputs/inputs.test.cluster.MD.lammps.polymer
    :language: python

The corresponding ``test_start_config_polymer.xyz`` file is the following: (note that _ is an underscore not a -)

.. literalinclude:: ../example_inputs/test_start_config_polymer.xyz

If multiple bonds or angles have to be defined per atom, use a comma to separate the entries without spaces, and if no entries are needed for an atom
still use a single underscore.

Some tips on setting the input parameters

Setting the random walk parameters                  
----------------------------------

When the walker configuration with the highest energy is chosen and replaced by a clone of 
another randomly picked walker, this clone has to be perturbed in order to satisfy the criteria 
that all walkers should be uniformly distributed in the available phase space. This perturbation 
is done by performing a random walk, modifying the atomic coordinates and the lattice parameters
if applicable. This can be done by one of the following different methods: MC, MD or GMC, 
set by the ``atom_algorithm`` keyword. Although infinitely long walks would be the best,
we can rarely wait that long, thus we have to determine a finite length we allow for the walk.
The length is determined by "step", i.e. the number of model calls. One MD timestep, one lattice 
modification, one atom type swap or one MC all-atom sweep is counted as a single model call. 
The number of model calls a user wants to be performed on a walker between its birth (by cloning) and 
discard (having the highest energy among all the walkers) is set by the ``n_model_calls_expected`` 
keyword. If the sampling is run in parallel, the code performs approximately ``n_model_calls_expected * n_cull / number_of_processors``
model calls on each processors at each iteration. This means that all walkers will perform 
``n_model_calls_expected`` steps on *average*.  Note that the code will continue to do
steps until it has done at least the requested number of calls, so this number may sometimes 
be exceeded, e.g.  if the last step is a long one (e.g. an atomic trajectory with multiple steps).

Currently the following step types are allowed: changing atomic coordinates, changing the volume of the
cell, changing the shape of the cell by shear, changing the shape of the cell by stretch, and swapping 
coordinates of different types of atoms. The ratio of these steps are determined by the keywords
``n_atom_steps``, ``n_cell_volume_steps``, ``n_cell_shear_steps``, ``n_cell_stretch_steps`` and ``n_swap_steps``,
respectively. E.g. if the values for these keywords are set as 10, 4, 4, 4, 3, respectively, then the probability 
of performing an atomic step will be 10/(10+4+4+4+3)=0.4, the probability of performing a volume change will be 0.16,...etc.
If any of these keywords is set to zero, the corresponding step type will never be performed.
It is important to consider that one ``n_atom_steps`` does not necessarily cover only one model call. To improve efficiency
several MD time steps or MC sweeps can be (and should be) performed consecutively, set by the parameter ``atom_traj_len``.
If ``atom_traj_len=8`` and an atomic step is chosen, then 8 model calls will be performed out of the 
total ``n_model_calls_expected``.



Minimum lattice height: ``MC_cell_min_aspect_ratio``
----------------------------------------------------

The fully flexible cell is introduced to remove the finite size effect whereby 
it may not be possible to arrange a fixed number of particles
in a fixed shape cell into certain crystal structures. In unfortunate cases this can exclude
thermodynamically relevant structures from the results of the calculation.
But for a flexible cell and for a finite number of particles, there exist simulation cells such that parallel
faces of the cell are separated by only a few layers of atoms, and those does not approximate the infinite fluid
in three dimensions. This problem can be solved by the introduction of a “minimum cell height” parameter.

The effect of the chosen minimum cell height is demonstrated in the case of the periodic system of 
64 Lennard-Jonesium particles in the figure below. The legend on the right shows the value of 
``MC_cell_min_aspect_ratio`` used in each simulation. The peak at lower temperature corresponds to melting,
and the peak at higher temperature to evaporation. The location of
the evaporation transition is converged for ``MC_cell_min_aspect_ratio`` ≥ 0.35, but melting requires
a higher ``MC_cell_min_aspect_ratio`` ≥ 0.65.  At low values of ``MC_cell_min_aspect_ratio`` the
system’s behaviour is dominated by the fictitious periodicity imposed by the boundary
conditions.

Restart a run
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If one needs to continue a run, i.e. perform more iteration cycles, the input file has to be modified with adding the following line

::

    restart_file=my_output.snapshot.all.extxyz


Include the keyword ``restart_file``. This defines the name of the file 
where all the walker configurations can be read from. This file should be produced by
concatenating the last saved snapshot files of all the processors. You might also need to increase the ``n_iter_per_walker``
value if the run already reached the number of iterations set previously. (Note: you do not have to comment out the ``start_species`` option.)
