About ``pymatnest``
==================================

The ``pymatnest`` package is a software
library written by Noam Bernstein in Fortran 95/python for the purpose of carrying out
nested sampling calculations.

Long term support of the package is ensured by:
 - Noam Bernstein (Naval Research Laboratory)
 - Gabor Csanyi (University of Cambridge)
 - Rob Baldock  (EPFL)
 - Livia Bartok-Partay (University of Warwick)
